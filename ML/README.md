# How It Works
Our calorie counter gives college students a way of tracking their daily nutrition. All they need to do is input everything they ate in a day and they will receive detailed nutrition information powered by the API Ninjas Nutrition API. They will also be able to read up on the importance of maintaining a healthy diet (even in college).
